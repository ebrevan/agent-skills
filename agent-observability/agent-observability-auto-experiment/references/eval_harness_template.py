"""Skeleton for `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.py`.

Copy this into `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.py` in iteration 1, then fill in the two TODOs:
`generate_output` (run the REAL code under test) and `judge` (a REAL LLM-as-judge call).

Hard rules (see references/rubrics.md):
  * NO score literals / hard-coded score arrays anywhere in this file. Every score is returned
    by `judge()` running over real data.
  * Score only scoreable target lines; EXCLUDE non-target/infra lines from the mean entirely
    (do not score them 0). The runner below skips a line when `generate_output` returns None.
  * The harness is written ONCE and reused verbatim across iterations — only the code under
    test (imported by `generate_output`) changes between iterations.

Usage: `python .auto_experiment/eval_harness.py`  -> writes eval_results.jsonl, prints
  {"mean", "stdev", "runs", "scored", "excluded", "run_means"}.

Judge prompt: `build_judge_prompt` below assembles it — trusted blocks (the `evaluators` rubric and
the config's `domain_notes`) first, then the untrusted datapoint content in sealed, separately
delimited blocks. Pass `domain_notes` in via `AUTO_EXP_DOMAIN_NOTES`; see SKILL.md "Domain notes".

Noise: `generate_output` (and an LLM judge) are stochastic, so a single run's mean is a
noisy estimate. The runner re-runs the WHOLE eval `AUTO_EXP_RUNS` times (default 3) and
reports the mean-of-runs plus the across-run stdev. The loop feeds that stdev into the
standard error of the difference of means, `SE_diff = √(sd_cand²/n + sd_best²/n)`, and keeps a
change as best whenever its point estimate improves in the goal's direction (and passes the
mechanism audit). The two-sample t-test (`|Δ|/SE_diff ≥ 2`, or `|Δ| ≥ min_delta` when SE_diff is 0)
is a CONFIDENCE label — a higher-in-direction move that is only within noise is kept but flagged
tentative, not discarded — NOT a keep gate, and NOT a raw-stdev band (raw stdev doesn't shrink with
runs). Only the mean/stdev are computed here; the gate itself lives in the loop. See
references/rubrics.md "Noise & keep/discard policy". Point at a specific data split with
`AUTO_EXP_DATA` (default data.jsonl).
